 * CLEANUP: Removed all trailing whitespace from all source-files.  This avoids many GIT (merge) warnings.
[Mar 12 2009]

 * MODIFIED: Renamed concat_atom/2,3 into atomic_list_concat/2,3 for compatibility.  Moved the old predicates into library(backcomp).  It is adviced to update your code, but 99% of the code will remain working because the old definitions are autoloaded.
   
[Jan 22 2009]

 * FIXED: Tracer handling of redo port.
   
 * EHANCED: Avoid that the gui-tracer ever reverts to the normal tracer by
   adding a catch-all rule.  Especially avoids deadlocks when tracing threads
   that cannot interact with the toplevel.
[Jul 7 2008]

 * ADDED: Prolog navigator listens to prolog_file_type/2.  Jean-Marc Vanel.
   
 * FIXED: Navigator failed to open on files with only directives.
[Jun 19 2008]

 * ADDED: Provide support for printing attributes in the GUI tracer

[Apr 23 2008]

 * ENHANCED: GUI tracer: expose variable details window

[Feb 22 2008]

 * FIXED: Avoid unknown class: yes messages if graphical tracer is active.

VERSION 1.1.1 for SWI-Prolog 5.0.2
==================================

* FIXED: Handling of I_CATCH and I_CONTEXT instructions for unifying and
  locating calls in clauses.

* FIXED: Avoid sending ->file: @nil to the source-view

* FIXED: `Up' pass through foreign frames, so we can really get to the top,
  regardless of intermediate foreign frames caused by breaks, XPCE message
  passing, etc.
