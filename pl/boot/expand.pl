/** <module> Prolog source-code transformation

This module specifies, together with dcg.pl, the transformation of terms
as they are read from a file before they are processed by the compiler.

The toplevel is expand_term/2.  This uses three other translators:

	* Conditional compilation
	* term_expansion/2 rules provided by the user
	* DCG expansion

Note that this ordering implies  that conditional compilation directives
cannot be generated  by  term_expansion/2   rules:  they  must literally
appear in the source-code.

Term-expansion may choose to overrule DCG   expansion.  If the result of
term-expansion is a DCG rule, the rule  is subject to translation into a
predicate.

Next, the result is  passed  to   expand_bodies/2,  which  performs goal
expansion.
